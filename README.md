DESCRIPTION  OF THE TASK 2 :The goal of this code is to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is designed to classify images into one of 10 categories (e.g., airplane, car, bird, etc.).
This is a basic implementation. You can improve the model by:
1. Adding more layers or using pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
2. Using data augmentation to reduce overfitting.
3. Tuning hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
